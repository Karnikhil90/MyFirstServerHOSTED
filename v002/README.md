# Introduction

This project focuses on implementing a login system initially, with plans to later incorporate the addition of new user IDs. The system comprises a frontend with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files. The backend is entirely developed in Python, with functionalities split into separate files for better organization. The data is stored in a JSON file, and a Python file reads and sends the data to the server as per the specified requirements.

## Project Structure

### Backend

#### ServerHost (server_host.py)

- Manages incoming requests and responds accordingly.

#### DataBase (database_reader.py)

- Reads and handles data stored in a JSON file.

### Frontend

#### HTML Files

- `index.html`: Login page.
- `profile.html`: User profile page.

#### JavaScript Files

- `main.js`: Main script for general functionality.
- `profile.js`: Script for user profile-related functionality.
- `login.js`: Script for login functionality.

#### CSS Files

- `main.css`: Main stylesheet.
- `profile.css`: Stylesheet for the user profile page.

### Data Storage

- `data.json`: JSON file storing user data.

This project initially focuses on creating a login system and will subsequently extend to include the addition of new user IDs. The backend is divided into separate Python files for handling server requests and reading the database. The data is stored in a JSON file, with scripts managing frontend functionality. Customize and extend the project as needed based on future requirements.
